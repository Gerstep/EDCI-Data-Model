# EDCI-Data-Model
Data Model for the Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure

<p> [Action 3 of the European Commission's Digital Education Action Plan](http://google.com)(https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-3-digitally-signed-qualifications_en) proposes the integration of digitally signed qualifications into the new Europass.</p>

<p>The following data model aims to capture the results of any non-formal, informal and formal learning across Europe. It is designed to provide a single format to describe certificates of attendance, examination results, degrees and diplomas, diploma supplements, professional certifications, employer recommendations and any other kind of claims that are related to learning.</p>

## Alignment with Other Standards
The EDCI Data Model is an extension of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model) expressed as XML/XSD, for the purposes of providing a standardised format of describing learning within the European Union and European Economic Area.

## Development Plan
* The current version of the data model provides a basic structure of claims, which are divided into activities, assessments and achievements.
* v0.2.0-1.0.0: will model Learning Opportunities and authorisation of NQF Qualifications. It will also link these concepts to the Common Information Model.
* v0.3.0-1.0.0: will incorporate the Europass Supplements
* v0.4.0-1.0.0: will describe credential revocation, as well as detailed display properties.

<p>The data model will be put into production as part of the Europass portal in Q1 2020.</p>
